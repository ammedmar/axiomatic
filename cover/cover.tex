	The importance of Steenrod squares in stable homotopy theory is hard to overstate, and their definition can be given in several different ways.
	Interest in explicit formulas defining cup-$i$ product, the original approach of Steenrod, has been recently rekindled by their use in the study of topological phases of matter.
	In this article we show that, similarly to how Steenrod squares can be axiomatically characterized, the cup-$i$ products of Steenrod are determined up to isomorphism -- and not just homotopy -- by just a few natural properties.
	This axiomatic framework allows us to prove that all formulas in the literature defining cup-$i$ products represent the same isomorphism class.
