\begin{abstract}
	We show that any construction of cup-$i$ products on the cochains of simplicial or semi-simplicial sets is isomorphic -- not just homotopic -- to Steenrod's original construction if it is natural, non-zero, minimal, irreducible, and free.
	We use this result to prove that all \mbox{cup-$i$} constructions in the literature represent the same isomorphism class.
