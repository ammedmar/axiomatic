	We introduce new formulae for Steenrod's cup-$i$ products on the singular chains of spaces and use them to prove that any other set of choices for the cup-$i$ products is isomorphic to Steenrod's if it is natural, minimal, non-degenerate, and free. We also show that all known natural choices satisfy these axioms, including those resulting from the operadic actions of McClure-Smith and Berger-Fresse, from the Eilenberg-Zilber contraction approach of Real--Gonzales-Diaz, and from the $E_\infty$-bialgebra structures defined by the author.
