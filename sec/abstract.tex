\begin{abstract}
	We show that any construction of cup-$i$ products on the normalized chains of simplicial sets is isomorphic -- not just homotopic -- to Steenrod's original construction if it is natural, minimal, non-degenerate, irreducible and free.
	We use this result to prove that all cup-$i$ constructions in the literature represent the same isomorphism class.
