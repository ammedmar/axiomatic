\begin{abstract}
	We show that any construction of cup-$i$ products on the normalized chains of simplicial sets is isomorphic -- not just homotopic -- to Steenrod's original construction if it is natural, minimal, non-degenerate, irreducible and free.
	Properties satisfied by all constructions of these products available in the literature.
