\section{Proof of our main theorem} \label{sec: proof}

%In this section we prove Theorem \ref{theorem: main}.
%We do so by establishing a linearly dual version stated as Theorem \ref{t:main reformulated}. The first subsection is devoted to formulating this dual version. The second reinterprets the freeness axiom in this language. The third establishes the base case of an induction. The fourth explores the relationship between the dual version of the cup-$i$ products and the boundary map of simplicial sets and the final subsection carries out the induction argument proving the theorem.
