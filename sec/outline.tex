\subsection*{Outline}

We present the notion of \mbox{cup-$i$} construction and our axiomatic characterization in \cref{s:statement}.
We postpone the proof of our main theorem until after \cref{s:reformulation}, where the statement is recasted in more category theoretic terms.
\cref{s:proof} is devoted to the proof of our axiomatic characterization.
In \cref{s:others} and \cref{s:operads} we show that all formulas in the literature give rise to isomorphic simplicial \mbox{cup-$i$} constructions.
We conclude this work in \cref{s:epilogue} discussing related and future work.
