\section{Related and future work}\label{s:epilogue}

%This section is included to provide context to our results and is logically independent of the rest of this paper.
%
%By an acyclic carrier argument \cite{eilenberg1953acyclic} all non-zero simplicial \mbox{cup-$i$} constructions are homotopic to each other.
%Any of them gives rise to the following celebrated cohomology operations introduced by Steenrod in \cite{steenrod1947products} through an explicit simplicial \mbox{cup-$i$} construction reviewed in \cref{ss:original}.
%
%\begin{definition*}
%	For any non-zero simplicial \mbox{cup-$i$} construction the \textbf{$k^\th$ Steenrod square} is defined on cocycle representatives by
%	\[
%	\begin{tikzcd} [column sep=tiny, row sep=0]
%	\Sq^k \colon &[-10pt] \rH^{-n} \arrow[r] & \rH^{-n-k} \\
%	& {[\alpha]} \arrow[r, mapsto] & \big[ \alpha \cup_{n-k} \alpha \big].
%	\end{tikzcd}
%	\]
%\end{definition*}
%
%These operations have been axiomatically characterized \cite{steenrod1962cohomology}, and one can interpret \cref{t:main} as a continuation of this result capturing the isomorphism type, and not just the homotopy type, of Steenrod's original construction.
%
%\begin{remark*}[Discrimination tools]
%	We can illustrate the additional discriminatory power offered by these operations considering the following isomorphisms:
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item As graded vector spaces, $\rH^\vee(\R P^2; \Ftwo) \cong \rH^\vee(S^1 \wedge S^2; \Ftwo)$
%		but they are distinguished by $\Sq^1$.
%		\item As graded modules, $\rH^\vee(\mathbb C P^2; \Z) \cong \rH^\vee(S^2 \wedge S^4; \Z)$
%		but they are distinguished by $\Sq^2$.
%		\item As graded rings, $\rH^\vee(\Sigma \mathbb C P^2; \Z) \cong \rH^\vee(\Sigma (S^2 \wedge S^4); \Z)$
%		but they are distinguished by $\Sq^2$.
%	\end{enumerate}
%\end{remark*}
%
%\begin{remark*}[Persistent homology]
%	Persistent homology is a method used on highly intensive data analysis tasks \cite{carlsson2008images, chan2013viral, lee2017quantifying} and for which various software projects exist \cite{bauer2021ripser, gudhi, medina2021giotto}.
%	Based on \cite{medina2022per_st}, the project \href{https://github.com/Steenroder/steenroder}{\texttt{steenroder}} incorporates into the persistent homology pipeline the additional information Steenrod squares provide using the formulas presented in \cref{d:my cup-i}.
%\end{remark*}

\subsection{Cup-(\textit{p,i}) products}

Steenrod squares are parameterized by classes on the mod $2$ homology of $\Sym_2$.
Steenrod used this group homology viewpoint to non-constructively define -- for any prime $p$ -- operations on the mod $p$ cohomology of spaces \cite{steenrod1952reduced, steenrod1953cyclic}.
To define these constructively for odd primes, May's operadic viewpoint \cite{may1970general} was used in \cite{medina2021may_st} to provide explicit \textbf{cup-$(p,i)$ constructions}, which were implemented in the computer algebra system \href{https://github.com/ammedmar/comch}{\texttt{ComCH}} \cite{medina2021comch}.
A \mbox{cup-$(p,i)$} construction is an $\cyc_p$-equivariant chain map
\[
W(p) \to \Hom(\chains, \chains^{\ot p})
\]
inducing an isomorphism in homology where $W(p)$
%\[
%\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=20pt]
%	W(p) = \Big(
%	\Fp[\Sym_p]\{e_0\} &
%	\Fp[\Sym_p]\{e_1\} \arrow[l, "\ \rho - \id"'] &
%	\arrow[l, "\ \id+\rho+\dots+\rho^{p-1}"'] \cdots \Big)
%\end{tikzcd}
%\]
%\[
%W(p) = \Big(
%\Fp[\Sym_p]\{e_0\}
%\xla{\rho-\id}
%\Fp[\Sym_p]\{e_1\}
%\xla{\id+\rho+\dots+\rho^{p-1}} \cdots \Big)
%\]
is the minimal resolution of $\Fp$ as an $\Fp[\Sym_p]$-module.
Studying the moduli of cup-$(p,i)$ constructions as done here for the $p = 2$ case is left to future work.

\subsection{Relations and secondary operations}

The cup-$i$ products provide an effective construction of coboundaries coherently witnessing the commutativity relation of the cohomological cup product at the cochain level.
These coboundaries define the squares, which are primary operations.
This comment invites the consideration of relations among the squares themselves.
There are two notable relations;
the first one, known as the \textit{Cartan relation}, expresses the interaction between these operations and the cup product:
\begin{equation*}
	\Sq^k \big( [\alpha] [\beta] \big) =
	\sum_{\mathclap{i+j=k}} \, \Sq^i\big([\alpha]\big) Sq^j\big([\beta]\big),
\end{equation*}
the second, the \textit{Adem relation} \cite{adem1952iteration}, expresses dependencies appearing through iteration:
\begin{equation*}
	\Sq^i \Sq^j =
	\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor i/2 \rfloor} \binom{j-k-1}{i-2k} \Sq^{i+j-k} \Sq^k.
\end{equation*}
Explicit cochains witnessing them were defined in \cite{medina2020cartan} and \cite{medina2021adem} respectively, and used in the classification of low dimensional invertible fermionic topological phases of matter in \cite{kapustin2017fermionic, barkeshli2021classification}.
The analogous result for the odd prime version of the Cartan relation appears in \cite{medina2023oddcartan}.

\subsection{Other shapes}

...

%\begin{remark*}[Transverse intersections]
%	Thom showed that every mod~$2$ homology class of a space is represented by the push-forward of the fundamental class of a closed manifold $W$ along some map to it.
%	Furthermore, if the target $M$ is a closed manifold, and therefore satisfies Poincar\'{e} duality
%	\[
%	PD \colon H^k(M ;\Ftwo) \to H_{\bars{M}-k}(M; \Ftwo),
%	\]
%	the cohomology class dual to the homology class represented by the intersection of two transverse maps $V \to M$ and $W \to M$ is the cohomology class $[\alpha] [\beta]$ where $[\alpha]$ and $[\beta]$ are respectively dual to the homology classes represented by $V \to M$ and $W \to M$.
%	By taking $[\alpha] = [\beta]$ of degree $-k$ we have that $\Sq^k \big( [\alpha] \big)$ is represented by the transverse self-intersection of $W \to M$.
%	A comparison lifting this one between intersection and the cup-$0$ product of cochains was given in \cite{medina2021flowing}.
%	A generalization of this result to \mbox{cup-$i$} products is the focus of current research \cite{medina2022foundations}
